Hello, world! I am a Software Engineer who studied Computer System Engineering
at the [Tshwane University of Technology](https://www.tut.ac.za/). My
qualification includes hardware and software, although I know logic gates,
resistors, transistors, and the rest of the low-level staff. My passion lies
more in software development. I am skilled in system design, Object-Oriented
Programming, and database design principles.

Currently solving business problems as a .NET Developer, specializing in
Microsoft technologies such as .NET Framework and MS SQL Servers. I have a
passion for text editors and servers, leveraging them to create innovative
solutions.

Outside Work Outside work, I enjoy watching TedTalk, science fiction movies, and
cartoons. I am a proud South African! I like hanging out with brilliant, driven,
creative, and destructive people who want to do more than talk about change.
